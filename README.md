# GAL Testing
Contains PLD files for testing out various pieces of
functionality with GAL chips. In particular, the GAL20V8 chip.

## Requirements
- [GALasm](https://github.com/daveho/GALasm) is needed to generate JED files from PLD files.
- [Minipro](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/) is needed to program GAL20V8 chips with a JED file using the [XGenu TL866 II Plus Programmer](http://www.xgecu.com/EN/TL866_main.html). 

## Logic Tester
This PLD file contains some basic logic equations.

### Todos

- [ ] Add schematic for the testing circuit.

## 8-bit Counter
This PLD file contains a self-increment 8-bit counter.

### Todos

- [ ] Add schematic for the testing circuit.
